*   **Frontend:** Angular `19.0.7`, TypeScript, RxJS, Stripe.js (`^6.1.0`), Chart.js (`^4.4.9`)
*   **Backend:** .NET `9.0.101` (C#), ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core
*   **Database:** SQL Server
*   **Payments:** Stripe

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed, matching the specified versions:

*   **Git:** For version control.
*   **.NET SDK:** Version **9.0.101**
*   **Node.js:** Version **22.13.0** (includes npm)
*   **Angular CLI:** Version **19.0.7** (`npm install -g @angular/cli@19.0.7` or use `npx`)
*   **SQL Server:** A running instance (Express, Developer, etc.).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Shopimy
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (.NET Server):**
    *   Navigate to the Server directory: `cd Server`
    *   **Database:**
        *   Ensure your SQL Server instance is running.
        *   Connect to SQL Server and create a new database (e.g., `Shopimy_Dev`).
        *   Execute the script `Database/TableCreation.sql` against the new database.
        *   *(Optional)* Execute `Database/SampleData.sql` for development data.
    *   **Configuration:**
        *   Open `Server/appsettings.json`.
        *   Update `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` with your database connection string.
        *   **Security:** For sensitive keys (Stripe, JWT), use `appsettings.Development.json`, `appsettings.secrets.json` (ignored by git), environment variables, or a secrets manager. **Do not commit secrets to `appsettings.json`**.

3.  **Frontend Setup (Angular WebClient):**
    *   Navigate to the WebClient directory: `cd ../WebClient`
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

### Running the Application

Run both backend and frontend simultaneously in separate terminals:

1.  **Backend (.NET Server):**
    ```bash
    cd Server
    dotnet run
    ```
    *(API typically runs on http://localhost:5000 or https://localhost:5001)*

2.  **Frontend (Angular WebClient):**
    ```bash
    cd WebClient
    npm start
    ```
    *(App typically runs on http://localhost:4200)*

Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.

*(For more detailed setup instructions, see [Documents/INSTALLATION.md](Documents/INSTALLATION.md))*

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Shopimy uses a standard Client-Server architecture:

*   **Frontend:** Angular SPA (`WebClient/`) handling UI and client-side logic. Uses shared components for store sections.
*   **Backend:** .NET RESTful API (`Server/`) handling business logic, data access, and external integrations.
*   **Database:** SQL Server for persistent storage. Includes tables for users, stores, products, orders, analytics (`StoreVisits`), promotions, etc.
*   **External Services:** Stripe for payments.

*(For a detailed breakdown, see [Documents/ARCHITECTURE.md](Documents/ARCHITECTURE.md))*

## ü§ù Contributing

Please adhere to the development guidelines:

1.  **Branching:** Create feature branches off `staging` named `dev-[your-name]`.
2.  **Workflow:** Understand task requirements (Jira/`tasks/tasks.md`), update status (`docs/status.md`), and create Pull Requests targeting `staging`.
3.  **Standards:** Follow coding standards (strict TypeScript, file size limits, DRY), formatting rules (ESLint/Prettier), and naming conventions.
4.  **Testing:** Practice TDD. Write comprehensive tests and ensure all tests pass before committing.
5.  **Security:** Prioritize security best practices (server-side validation, no hardcoded secrets).
6.  **AI Collaboration:** Follow the guidelines in `.cursorrules` for effective AI interaction. Review all AI-generated code critically.
7.  **Documentation:** Keep relevant documentation updated with your changes.

*(For full guidelines, see [Documents/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md](Documents/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md) and [.cursorrules](.cursorrules))*
