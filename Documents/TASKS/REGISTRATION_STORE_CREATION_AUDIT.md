# TASK: End-to-End Review and Audit of Registration & Store Creation

**Goal:** Perform a comprehensive end-to-end review and audit of the user registration and store creation processes. Analyze both frontend (Angular) and backend (.NET) code, database schema, and data flow to ensure functionality, data integrity, security, and adherence to project requirements and best practices outlined in `.cursorrules`.

**Context:**
The application allows users to register and subsequently create their own online store. These are fundamental user flows involving frontend forms, API interactions, backend logic for user/store creation, and database persistence. Ensuring these core flows are robust, secure, and that data is handled correctly across the entire stack is critical for application stability and user trust.

**Scope:**

1.  **User Registration Process:**
    *   **Frontend:** Analyze `RegisterComponent` UI/logic, form validation (`register.component.ts`), and data submission via `UserService`.
    *   **Backend:** Review `AccountController` (`/register` endpoint logic), server-side input validation, password hashing (BCrypt usage), and user creation logic.
    *   **Database:** Examine `Users` table schema (`TableCreation.sql`) for correctness (data types, constraints, nullability) and verify data persistence.
    *   **Data Flow:** Trace registration data from the frontend form through the service and controller to the database.
    *   **Requirements Check:** Verify against `REQUIREMENTS.md` (FR4.1.*).
    *   **Known Issues:** Note the pending email verification flow (`EMAIL_MANAGEMENT.md`) but audit the *existing* registration flow's integrity.

2.  **Store Creation / Initial Setup Process:**
    *   **Frontend Trigger:** Analyze logic in `StoreOwnerDashboardComponent` for prompting store creation if none exists.
    *   **Frontend Editor:** Review `StoreEditorComponent` and `ThemesComponent` for UI/logic related to store details (name, URL), theme selection, and component visibility selection.
    *   **Frontend Service:** Examine `StoreService` API calls (`createStore`, `updateStore`) for creating/updating the store.
    *   **Backend:** Review `StoreController` (`CreateStore`, `UpdateStore` actions), input validation (URL format, name uniqueness), user authorization checks (ensure user owns the store), and data persistence logic.
    *   **Database:** Examine `Stores`, `StoreThemes`, `StoreBanners`, `StoreLogos` table schemas (`TableCreation.sql`) for correctness, relationships (foreign keys), and data persistence. Check if transactions are used appropriately when multiple tables are modified.
    *   **Data Flow:** Trace store configuration data from the editor through the service and controller to the relevant database tables.
    *   **Requirements Check:** Verify against `REQUIREMENTS.md` (FR4.2.1, FR4.2.3).
    *   **Known Issues:** Verify fixes/implementation status for related tasks in `TASKS.md` (e.g., Store Name Derivation bug, Saving All Config, Component Visibility persistence, Initial Store Setup Workflow).

    *   `Server/Data/AppDbContext.cs`
    *   `Server/Program.cs` (Auth, DI, CORS config)
*   **Database:**
    *   `Database/TableCreation.sql` (Specifically `Users`, `Stores`, `StoreThemes`, `StoreBanners`, `StoreLogos` definitions)
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `.cursorrules`
    *   `Documents/ARCHITECTURE.md`
    *   `Documents/REQUIREMENTS.md`

    *   `Documents/EMAIL_MANAGEMENT.md`
    *   `Documents/TASKS/STORE_BUILD_REVIEW.md` (Cross-reference findings)

**Instructions / Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Thorough Analysis:** Examine the code and data flow for both registration and store creation from frontend submission to database persistence.
2.  **Identify Issues:** Document any findings related to:
    *   **Bugs:** Functional errors, incorrect logic, unexpected behavior.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Missing data fields, incorrect relationships, potential race conditions, lack of transactions where necessary (especially in store creation involving multiple tables).
    *   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Missing authorization checks, improper input validation (client *and* server-side), exposure of sensitive data (e.g., password handling), potential injection points.
    *   **Inconsistencies:** Deviations from documented requirements (`REQUIREMENTS.md`) or architecture (`ARCHITECTURE.md`).
    *   **Usability/UX Issues:** Poor error handling/feedback, lack of loading states, confusing user flows.
    *   **Code Quality:** Violations of `.cursorrules` (e.g., large files, duplication, lack of comments for complex logic).
3.  **Verify Requirements & Known Issues:** Explicitly check if the implementation meets the functional requirements (FR4.1.*, FR4.2.*) and the status/resolution of known issues listed in `TASKS.md`.
4.  **Database Checks:** Review relevant table schemas for appropriate constraints (UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL) and data types. Assess transaction usage in backend operations modifying multiple tables.
5.  **Propose Solutions:** For each identified issue, clearly describe the problem, its potential impact, and propose specific, actionable fixes using code blocks (`.ts`, `.cs`, `.sql`) where applicable. Explain the reasoning behind the proposed solution.
6.  **Adherence:** Ensure all analysis and proposed solutions strictly adhere to the guidelines in `.cursorrules`.

**Priority:** ðŸ”¥ High

**Dependencies:** Understanding of project architecture (`ARCHITECTURE.md`), requirements (`REQUIREMENTS.md`), and existing tasks (`TASKS.md`).
