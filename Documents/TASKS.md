### Shopping Cart & Checkout
-   [ ] üî• **Integrate Cart with Checkout:** Pass actual cart items and total amount to the `PaymentService.createCheckoutSession` call instead of placeholders. (`CheckoutComponent`, `ShoppingService`)
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement Cart Quantity Updates:** Allow users to change item quantities directly in the cart UI. (`ShoppingCartComponent`, `ShoppingCartController`)
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Persist Cart for Logged-in Users:** Ensure `ShoppingCartController` correctly saves/retrieves cart state to/from the database (`ShoppingCarts` table). Test persistence across sessions. (`ShoppingService`, `ShoppingCartController`)
-   [ ] üßä **Implement Guest Checkout Flow:** Design and implement the process for users to purchase without creating an account. (`REQUIREMENTS.md`)

### Payments (Stripe Integration)
-   [ ] üî• **Implement Order Creation Logic:** Create an order record in the database *before* creating the Stripe Checkout Session, including necessary details and a 'Pending' status. Pass the internal order ID in Stripe metadata. (`PaymentController`)
-   [ ] üî• **Implement Order Fulfillment Logic:** In the Stripe webhook handler (`checkout.session.completed`), use the session/metadata to find the internal order, update its status to 'Paid'/'Processing', decrease stock, and trigger confirmation emails/digital delivery. (`PaymentController`)
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Refine Payment Method Management:** Ensure the flow for adding, viewing, deleting, and setting default payment methods works seamlessly end-to-end. (`UserPaymentController`, `ProfileComponent` - Store Owner)
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Handle Payment Failures:** Implement robust handling for failed payments both in Stripe Checkout redirects and webhook events. Provide clear user feedback. (`PaymentController`, `CancelComponent`)

### Reviews & Ratings
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement Review Submission:** Create backend endpoint and frontend UI for authenticated users to submit ratings and comments for products they've purchased. (`ReviewsController`, `ItemPageComponent` or similar)
-   [ ] üßä **Implement Review Moderation:** Design and implement features for store owners to manage/moderate reviews. (`REQUIREMENTS.md FR4.6.3`)

### Analytics
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement Backend Analytics Tracking:** Add logic to track views, sales, etc., and store/aggregate this data. (`REQUIREMENTS.md FR4.7.1`)
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Connect Analytics Frontend:** Fetch and display actual analytics data in the `AnalyticsComponent` instead of placeholders. (`AnalyticsComponent`, `AnalyticsService`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt & Refactoring

-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Review `ItemsController.cs`:** Decide whether to reintegrate, replace, or remove the commented-out stock update logic. Ensure stock updates are handled correctly elsewhere if removed.
-   [ ] üßä **Refactor Large Components:** Review components for potential breakdown into smaller, reusable parts (check against `.cursorrules` file size limit).
-   [ ] üßä **Consolidate API Calls:** Review frontend services for potential consolidation or optimization of HTTP requests.
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling:** Systematically review error handling in both frontend and backend. Ensure consistent logging and user-friendly feedback.
-   [ ] üßä **Code Style Consistency:** Run linters/formatters (ESLint, Prettier for frontend; .NET formatting tools for backend) across the codebase.

## ‚úÖ Testing

-   [ ] üî• **Increase Unit Test Coverage:** Add more unit tests for services, controllers, and components, focusing on critical logic (auth, payments, cart).
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement Integration Tests:** Add integration tests for API endpoints, especially those involving database interactions or external services (Stripe - potentially mocked).

-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Refine Deployment Scripts/Process:** Improve upon the steps in `DEPLOYMENT.md`. Consider automating steps.
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated builds, tests, and deployments to Staging/Production.
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configure Production Environment:** Set up secure configuration management (environment variables, secrets manager) for production secrets (DB connection string, API keys, JWT secret).
-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Set up Monitoring & Logging:** Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions for production (e.g., Application Insights, CloudWatch, Sentry).

## ‚ú® UI/UX Improvements

-   [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement Loading States:** Ensure appropriate loading indicators (`LoadingOneComponent` or similar) are used during data fetching or processing across the application.
-   [ ] üßä **Refine UI based on Figma:** Conduct a review against the Figma designs and implement necessary adjustments for visual consistency and usability.
-   [ ] üßä **Improve Mobile Responsiveness:** Test thoroughly on various mobile devices and refine styles where needed.
